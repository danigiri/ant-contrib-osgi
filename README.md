ant-contrib-osgi
================

Ant Contrib OSGi packaging as a fragment that attaches to an OSGi bundle named 'org.apache.ant'. To use, build using 'mvn package' and add the resulting fragment jar to your OSGi environment and use the ant-contrib tasks normally (don't forget to add ```<taskdef resource="net/sf/antcontrib/antcontrib.properties"/>``` to your xml file).

Enjoy! :+1:
